# Shopify Polaris Vue

Polaris Vue by Ownego only supports **Vue 3.3+**.

Polaris Vue based on [Shopify Polaris style guide](https://polaris.shopify.com/), built especially for Vue 3.
We're trying to make it mostly close with Shopify style guide and get a better performance.

**Follow Polaris React version:** [12.19.0](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/releases/tag/%40shopify%2Fpolaris%4012.19.0)

---

We're using this library for our apps and got `Built for Shopify` badge, so hopefully it will be helpful for you too.
